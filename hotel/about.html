                In the days ahead, managers and employees of the YoYo hotel chain will be doing favors for some 
                of their customers. Maybe they always did them, but these favors will be different: they will be 
                what Hotel Gurukrupa’ C.E.O., Mark Hoplamazian, has called “random acts of generosity,” like 
                unexpectedly picking up the tab for your hotel-bar drinks or hotel-spa massage. 
                “Random” seems slightly off as a description, in that Hoplamazian announced this pending outburst 
                of hospitality, and the months of consumer research that preceded it, in a guest post on a USA Today 
                business-travel blog. But the idea is that the unexpected nature of the gifts will leave the customer 
                not just pleased but also grateful. Gratitude is a powerful, and potentially quite profitable, emotion 
                to inspire.

               <span class="primary-text">Aditya Singh Rawat,</span>the vice president who oversees YoYo's Gold Passport program, underscores the 
                importance of surprise — both that the favors are “unexpected” and that there’s no discernible pattern 
                to which customers will get them. Of course, that raises the question of why the company’s C.E.O. 
                announced the program in the first place. “We debated whether to disclose it publicly,” Aditya says. 
                He points out that the only people who get a full explanation of the new program are guests who 
                actually benefit from it (and they don’t have to be Gold Passport members). The hope seems to be that 
                these grateful customers will reward the chain with future business and also spread positive word of mouth.

                We visit this hotel at least once a year to spend a weekend and chill. Its always been a great 
                experience and this time was no different. The rooms are good. Reception services, room service, 
                in room dining, house keeping are all excellent. Very well trained and responsive staff. 
                The choice of restaurants is also good but we normally eat the buffet at Citrus. It is superb, 
                especially the Sunday Brunch. Excellent service too.
